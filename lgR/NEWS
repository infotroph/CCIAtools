New in version 0.2.0:
	Change in data format: the "filename" variable in dataframes read by `readflow.day` or `readbatch.day` now contains the whole basename of the file on disk instead of just the sequential-numbered portion.
	old:
		> a = readflow.day("01Aug2014", path="~/data")
		> unique(a$filename)
		[1] "f0000" "f0001" "f0002"
	new:
		> a = readflow.day("01Aug2014", path="~/data")
		> unique(a$filename)
		[1] "01Aug2014_f0000.txt.zip" "01Aug2014_f0001.txt.zip" "01Aug2014_f0002.txt"
	If you have code that relies on the old naming scheme, recover it with:
		> a$filename = gsub(".*_([bf][0-9]{4}).*", "\\1", a$filename)
